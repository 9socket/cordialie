# awareness
Cordialie was also designed to teach people an important aspect of Cyber Security.  And that heavly revolves around the passwords people use for any account.  Hopefully this 
tool demostrates why it's a bad idea to use passwords containing personal information, as this script heavily takes advantage of that.  A good password would be considered as a string of random characters, 25+ letters long.  A password manager is a great option as well, theres no such thing as too many precautions when it comes to security.
